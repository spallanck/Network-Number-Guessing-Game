This program represents a number guessing game using a server and client. The server will start with a secret number and the client then begins guessing. Each time the client incorrectly guesses the hidden number, some arithmetic is performed on the server side and the hidden number changes. The game continues until eventually the hidden number is guessed, or the client loses. For every incorrect guess the client makes, the server will print information about if the guess was too high or too low. The client can lose the game by pushing the hidden number out of bounds (greater than or equal to 256 or less than -256). The server also needs to be able to handle multiple clients playing the game.
